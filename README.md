# SCSS
- Install sass-loader which allows us import sass files, node-sass which takes our scss files and converts it to css. Sass-loader is going to use the node-sass behind the scene to convert the file
- Browsers use REM as default. 1rem=16px. this is how we convert rem to pixels systems in our app. in _base.css
                 
                 html {
                    font-size: 62.5%;
                  }
 16px * 62.5% = 10px Now we will be working on 10 PIXELS base.
 we place the settings that we use all over the app in to the **_base.scss** partial.
 

### BEM block, element and modifier
 - We can use nesting elements inside the class but it will make a mess like callback hell. We avoid it.
 - **Header** is a block, element is thing that goes inside the block, for example **button**. **disabled** props on button is a modifier.
 - .button__h1  ==> this is convention for element
   .button--link ==> this is convention for modifier
 
 **NOTE:** background proerty in css is shorthand for:
          background-color
          background-image
          background-position
          background-repeat
          background-attachment
          background-clip
          background-origin
          background-size 
 ### CSS Reset
 It makes sure that all browsers are starting from the same place. Each browser has their own set of default styles and if they are not all starting from the same place they are going to look a little different when we actually apply our styles. So not using reset is equivalent to giving two of your directions to your house. The only problem is the directions are the same but they are starting from different locations. in /src/main.js 
               
               require("normalize.css/normalize.css");//use it before require("./styles/styles.scss");

since we have need to use a css file and scss both in our project we adjust webpack dev and prod
                 //dev-client
                 
                 {
                    test: /\.s?css$/,
                    use: [
                      { loader: ExtractCssChunks.loader },
                      { loader: "css-loader" },
                      { loader: "sass-loader" }
                    ]
                  },              
                  //dev-server
                   {
                    test: /\.scss$/,
                    use: [{ loader: "css-loader" }, { loader: "sass-loader" }]
                  },
- Create **/base/_settings.scss** to place our variables. If we need to tweak any variable, we tweak it once and the change will be applied everywhere that they are used. Be aware that when you import this file into main scss file, this should be imported on top, so other files can use those variables.

- scss has built-in function. [here is color functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color) I used Vlighten($purple, 30%) and darken($purple, 10%) functions.

### Styling React Modal

- React Modal comes with its own DOM structure and its own set of classes. We have to explore how those classes work and then we have to override their styles. So we have to check on elements panel.
if you open React Modal in the project, you will see a new div will be injected into the DOM.

    <body class="ReactModal__Body--open">
      <div data-react-modal-body-trap="" tabindex="0" style="position: absolute; opacity: 0;"></div>
       
   inside the body, under script tag we have this
      
    
        <div class="ReactModalPortal">
        <div class="ReactModal__Overlay ReactModal__Overlay--after-open" style="position: fixed; top: 0px; left: 0px; right:        0px; bottom: 0px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);">
        <div class="ReactModal__Content ReactModal__Content--after-open" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-label="Selected Option" style="position: absolute; top: 40px; left: 40px; right: 40px; bottom: 40px; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); background: rgb(255, 255, 255); overflow: auto; border-radius: 4px; outline: none; padding: 20px;">
                <h3>  Selected Option  </h3>
                <p>  gigh  </p>
                <button>  OK  </button> //this is where our code 
        </div>
        </div>
        </div>
        <div data-react-modal-body-trap="" tabindex="0" style="position: absolute; opacity: 0;">
        </div>
        </body>

  React Modal puts the code inside the div whose className="ReactModalPortal"
  
 ##### Adding transition to open the modal
         // when this div placed into the dom, make all the children div s invisible
         .ReactModalPortal > div {
          opacity: 0;
        }
        //when ReactModal__Overlay class is placed add a transition effect to the target eleement with eace-in-out function
        .ReactModalPortal .ReactModal__Overlay {
          transition: opacity 500ms ease-in-out;
        }
        //after transition is over and .ReactModal__Overlay--after-open is placed make opacity 1
        .ReactModalPortal .ReactModal__Overlay--after-open {
          opacity: 1;
        }

 To add closing transition React-Modal has a prop
                    
                    closeTimeoutMS={300}
                    
  - All of the elements that we added into the Modal is under the *ReactModal__Content* div. But React-modal has a className property to overwrite this classname.
                     
                    className="modal"

   To position this div, we need to add "flex" property to the parent div which is *ReactModal__Overlay*
   
           .ReactModalPortal .ReactModal__Overlay {
          transition: opacity 500ms ease-in-out;
          justify-content: center;
          align-items: center;
          display: flex;
            }
            
          .modal {
            background: $dark-blue;
            color: white;
            max-width: 30rem;
            outline: none;
            padding: $l-size;
            text-align: center;
                }
 
 Now we have to target this:
                
               <h3>  Selected Option  </h3>
               <p>  gigh  </p>
               <button>  OK  </button>
               
  we need to add classNames inside the OptionModal component
  
      <h3 className="modal__title">Selected Option</h3>
      {props.selectedOption && (
        <p className="modal__body">{props.selectedOption}</p>
      )}
      <button className="button" onClick={props.closeModal}>
        OK
      </button>
      
 - If someone enters a very long word, it will break the UI. If you try it, you will see the word will not be broken. word will be pushing out the box. Because by default words do not break. so we break it by tweaking "word-break" property.
 
             .modal__title {
              margin: 0 0 $l-size 0;
            }

            .modal__body {
              margin: 0 0 $l-size 0;
              font-size: 2rem;
              font-weight: 300;
              word-break: break-all;
            }

  
##### Mobile Considerations
- The User-Agent is a request header provides essential information of the requesting client, especially for certain recipient in our app for server, it‚Äôs just a string describing the operating system, engine, browser - including their versions.
          
          Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36 
          
 Most of the mobile devices concatenate ‚ÄúMobile‚Äù keyword to the userAgent, which controversially could serve our server in order to detect wisely the device type of the client:. with [UAParser.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ua-parser-js) package we can strip the user agent out of the request object.
 
    const uaParser = require('ua-parser-js');

    const userAgent = uaParser(req.headers['user-agent']);
    
Then with the **context** prop of the StaticBrowser we can pass it to the client. 

There are a few drawbacks to this strategy. üòû

   First of all, the information we can extract out of the userAgent is pretty limited. Namely, we cannot understand the device properties (dimensions, orientation, etc.) directly. Indeed, it might be possible to infer the viewport dimensions someway, however then again - it leaves the orientation (and others) unsolved.

   Secondly, it doesn‚Äôt cover the scenario we render different components per each breakpoint. Obviously, we can say that our server infers the dimensions independently using the provided type and thereafter passes them to the application to be used as defaults - but practically, that‚Äôs not doable in case of a variety of breakpoints.

   Thirdly, we assumed that the userAgent includes ‚ÄúMobile‚Äù keyword on mobile devices whereas it‚Äôs not completely true. Some of the browsers concatenate unique variations instead; such as ‚ÄúMobi‚Äù, ‚ÄúIEMobile‚Äù and even ‚ÄúTablet‚Äù. Although libraries like UAParser.js typically consider them, that‚Äôs a concern we should recognize. And worse, these keywords might be missing when rendering using a desktop browser that‚Äôs resized to mobile dimensions - which would probably lead to DOM tree mismatches.

We can use pure CSS. Add this to our server-side html template:
 
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

in our css we use `@media (condition) {} ` to define our css conditionally. Main consideration for mobile devices is to change the flex-drection to column instead of row. By default once you add the `display:flex`, its direction is row. But in small devices we focus on positionin elements under each other. 

     //_add_option.scss
     
     .add-option {
    display: flex;
    padding: $m-size;
    flex-direction: column;
    }
    // in general flex direction should be column so input and button should posistioned under each other.
    //In media query we add the codidion that between 45rem-infinity, flex-direction under the .add-option class should be row. So between 0-45rem which is for small devicess, it will be column.
    // $desktop-breakpoint:45rem
     @media (min-width: $desktop-breakpoint) {
      .add-option {
        flex-direction: row;
      }
      .add-option__input {
        margin: 0 $s-size 0 0;
      }
     }

 ### Adding favicon to the project
 
 Install [react-favicon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-favicon)
 
 in /src/app.js
 
      import React from "react";
      import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
      import TaskApp from "./components/TaskApp";
      import Favicon from "react-favicon";
      import img from "./images/pict.jpg";

      function render(Component) {
        ReactDOM.hydrate(
          <div>
            <Favicon url={img} />
            <Component />
          </div>,
          document.getElementById("react-root")
        );
      }

      render(TaskApp);

 **NOTE:** it can be any type image file. if you are using a different image type that you did not inform file-loader you have to conifgure webpack. for example If you want to use favicon.ico 
 
        {
        test: /\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico)$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "file-loader",
            options: { name: "images/[name].[ext]" }
          }
        ]
      }
